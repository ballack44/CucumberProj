Cucumber HW project
Task:
Implement a feature file in java that compares two lists to ensure they contain the same items with three attributes (name, price, and category), regardless of order. If there are discrepancies, log a detailed message specifying which items and columns do not match. You can use any Java versions, libraries, frameworks and tools.
